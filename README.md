Salesforce Reports & Dashboard Project

This project showcases my hands-on experience in Salesforce Reports and Dashboards, focusing on data visualization, business analysis, and metric-driven decision-making.
The work was designed to demonstrate strong analytical and CRM reporting capabilities for a professional Salesforce environment.

Overview

The goal of this project was to design and build multiple Salesforce reports and combine them into a custom dashboard that provides insights into:
New Opportunities by Stage
Open Cases by Account
Account Distribution by Type and Country
Overall Opportunity Value and Performance Indicators

Key Features & Techniques
Reports:
Tabular, Summary, and Matrix Reports to organize and analyze data at different levels.
Buckets & Grouping to categorize opportunity stages and account types.
Matrix Buckets & Charts to visualize relationships between dimensions like Type and Billing Country.
Percentage of Total Opportunities per Stage using summary formulas.
Weighted Opportunity Value to estimate potential revenue based on probability.
Conditional Formatting & Row-Level Formulas for better readability and performance tracking.
Joined Reports to combine multiple data sets in a single view for executive insights.

Dashboard:
A Salesforce Lightning Dashboard built from multiple reports.
Includes bar charts, gauges, number cards, and donut charts for quick insights.
Visualizes KPIs such as total opportunity value, deal stage performance, and customer distribution.
